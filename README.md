## 👩🏻‍💻 Welcome to my portfolio website!

<span> My name is Amber Abreu. I am a Software Engineer from Brooklyn, NY. People describe me as ambitious, enthusiastic, and a natural leader.</span>

The purpose of this project was to build a portfolio that can be easily customized using the features that SASS provides. Using Gatsby also creates seamless transitions upon visiting the site and switching between different pages. By incorporating the Notion API as a CMS, I can also easily upload blog posts from my phone, computer, or tablet.
